						I am sure you must have had several road trips in your life because come on who does not like a road trip? Right? But honestly, the one in Iceland is nothing like you have had before. It is beautiful to such an extent that it feels surreal. Yes, you might have seen like unlimited pictures of Iceland by now because these days Iceland is a hot tourist spot, but let me tell you something.

						Driving route: Southwest to Northwest Attractions: No major attractions really Campsite for the night: Ólafsvik campsite We had our flight to Iceland Keflavik International airport at 8 AM from Copenhagen International airport. It was a 3.5 hour flight. The flight was 40% empty. We reached Keflavik around 9:30 AM. Yes, it is 2 hour behind the Central European time zone.
  Flying away to my dream destination   We had scheduled a pickup from our camper car company, which is Kuku Campers (read more about them here) at 10:00 AM.

  We stepped outside and it was chilly and beautiful. Everything was covered with a thin sheet of snow and it seemed white mountains are calling me. But before that, we had to have our breakfast.

						Attractions: Hallgrimskirkja, Solfar/Sun Voyager sculpture, Harpa Reykjavik Concert Hall and Conference Centre, Lake Tjornin It was raining hard on day 9, which was also our last day of our Iceland trip. To be more precise, the whole Euro trip. We did not want to go out really, but of course, we did go out. I did not want to waste my last day just like that.
Our first stop was Hallgrimskirkja, a Lutheran Parish church, which also happens to be the tallest church in Iceland.
