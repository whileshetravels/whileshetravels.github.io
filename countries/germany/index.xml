      <description>Let me be very clear first. 2 days in Berlin is far from ideal, but hey, if you are running tight on the schedule, a couple of days in Berlin would give you a good impression of how this city is. We were in Berlin on christmas day and the day after. The christmas spirit was super high, as we expected.
  Berlin, a city with so much history!   After having spent a day in Dresden, we took a bus (flixbus) from Dresden at 8:30 AM and reached Berlin at 10:45 AM.</description>

      <description>We wanted to visit a new place during christmas and we chose Germany. Close to Prague with so much crazy history. We started with visiting Dresden on the day of Christmas eve. We took a bus (Flixbus) from Praha hl.n. to Dresden hbf. It took us about 2 hours to get there. Pretty smooth ride.
