      <description>Alaska is beautiful and I know I am stating the obvious. D and I always wanted to go to Alaska but the problem was we do not have a driving license. Hey, we are working on that part. As they say, “Where there is a will, there is a way”, we found out cabs do work fine in some parts of Alaska. No Uber though. We planned out everything a month ahead.</description>
