						<p>Nice (/ˈniːs/, French pronunciation: ​[nis]; Niçard Occitan: Niça, classical norm, or Nissa, nonstandard, pronounced [ˈnisa]; Italian: Nizza [ˈnittsa]; Greek: Νίκαια; Latin: Nicaea) is the fifth most populous city in France and the capital of the Alpes-Maritimes département. The urban area of Nice extends beyond the administrative city limits, with a population of about 1 million[1][2] on an area of 721 km2 (278 sq mi).[1] Located in the French Riviera, on the south east coast of France on the Mediterranean Sea, at the foot of the Alps, Nice is the second-largest French city on the Mediterranean coast and the second-largest city in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d&rsquo;Azur region after Marseille. Nice is about 13 kilometres (8 miles) from the principality of Monaco, and its airport is a gateway to the principality as well.</p>

						Luxembourg Garden is nothing you have not seen before, but to find such a spacious place in Paris which is ideal for both children and adults is not easy, and that’s what makes this garden so special.
  Just relaxing in the garden with the view of the Palace   Luxembourg Garden is situated on the Left Bank and it is well maintained. It has a lot of benches and chairs and we were just sitting there for almost an hour.

						We were really tired doing this sightseeing and wanted to do something different. Having never been the Disneyland Florida before, we thought let’s try the one here in Paris. We knew this one is not as good as the one in Florida after doing a ton of research, but it was worth a shot and I was in a mood of some adrenaline rush.

						Notre Dame de Paris meaning “Our Lady of Paris” is one of the largest and famous churches in the world. It is a fine example of Gothic architecture and being in Paris, if you do not see the Notre Dame de Paris, even just the cathedral which is free, it is really your loss. If possible, make sure you go all the way up the tower (not free) and admire the city of lights and gargoyles.

						If you are in Paris and have seen everything, and want to get away from the City of lights and its crowd for some time, Crécy-la-Chapelle would be an ideal place to do so.
  Crécy-la-Chapelle   Crécy-la-Chapelle is a small town and you can call it a mini Venice. It takes only an hour from Paris. We had been thinking to visit this town since some time and after missing our train to Mont Saint Michel, we finally did it.

						Le Mont Saint-Michel, an island commune in Normandy, is one of the most popular day trips from Paris and obviously, we had our heart set on it long before we came to Paris. It is situated in the middle of the bay and is famous for its abbey and having been to Etretat, another commune in Normandy, I was super excited for Mont Saint-Michel. I am sorry I got no picture to show and don’t want to use any Google image.

						The Musée de l’Armée or the Army museum as the name suggests exhibits France’s complete military history along with the tomb of Napoleon. It is a perfect place if you love history. Even if you do not, you should visit this museum just for Napoleon, the man who conquered almost every part of Europe.
We left at 11 in the morning and took metro, line 8 and got off at La Tour Mauborg.

						If you are an art lover, you don’t need any introduction to the Musée du Louvre, and if you are not, this is the museum where you find the famous Mona Lisa, Venus de Milo and more than 30,000 work of arts. We visited the Louvre after the Musée d&rsquo;Orsay, which was not in the right order actually. The Louvre museum houses the art works from the ancient world to 1850 and the Orsay museum got stuff from 1850 onwards.

						Père Lachaise Cemetery is one of the most peaceful cemeteries I have ever been to not to mention it is quite big and free, and in the month of January, it was so calm that it gave a kind of an eerie feeling. I know all cemeteries do. It got about 5000 trees and does look like a park. It is a star cemetery filled with the tombs of Oscar Wilde to Jim Morrison.

						I have always heard about the Avenue des Champs-Élysées pronounced as Shon-zay-LEE-zay, that how grand and Parisian this avenue is. Taking a stroll around this avenue on a rainy January night made me feel a Parisian too, temporarily. We took metro line 9 and got off at Franklin D Roosevelt and that’s where the Avenue des Champs-Élysées started.
  The Avenue of Champs-Élysées   Known for its cafes, theaters, branded shops, Bastille Day Military Parade and the Tour de France, Avenue des Champs-Élysées stretches between Place de la Concorde and the Arc de Triomphe, which is one of the most famous monuments in Paris.

						Montmartre is a hill situated in Paris’ 18 arrondissement and this neighborhood is quite different from the arrondissement we had been to. It is trendy, crowded, and kind of seedy, and a place where many famous people have lived or worked from Van Gogh to Pablo Picasso. Even now, there are many artists and portraitists working here to exhibit and sell their artwork.
  The view of Paris from the hill     Clear skies would have been better   We left on a Saturday afternoon using metro, line 4 and got off at Barbes.

						Pont des Arts is that famous bridge where couples used to make their love for each other memorable by attaching love lock with their names engraved or written to the railing or the grate of the bridge and tossing the keys into the Seine river below. No, this trend did not start centuries ago. It was pretty recent. The year was 2008.
  The bridge links the domed Institut de France to the Louvre museum   I might have done the same with D though he would have disapproved for sure, but since 2014, the locks have been removed as they’re damaging the bridge with their weights.

						Versailles is one of the most exquisite palaces of the world and a clear example of how pretentious kings used to be in the past. Started as a hunting lodge by Louis XIII in 1623, the Sun King, Louis XIV spent a great deal of money to convert his dad’s lodge into a grand palace.
  This whole damn thing looks like it is made of gold.   If you ask anyone for a day trip from Paris, Versailles would be the number one answer.

						I was looking for a day trip from Paris and Étretat attracted me right away. It is a beautiful small town in Normandie region of France, with pebble beaches and unique shaped cliffs and arches. It takes about 3.5 hours one way from Paris to reach Etretat. I do not think I can justify its beauty in my post, but I would try and pictures would help.
  The serenity!

						Honestly, I have never been a museum enthusiast, but Paris is kind of a mecca of museums with the work of many world famous artists. The first place I visited in Paris was Musée d&rsquo;Orsay pronounced as mew-zay-dor-say. Being one of the largest art museums in Paris, it houses the work of Manet, Monet, Cézanne, Van Gogh, Rodin, Gauguin and many other famous artists. You would find Impressionism at its best here.
