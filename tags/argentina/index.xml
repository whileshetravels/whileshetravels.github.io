      <description>Buenos Aires is the capital and largest city of Argentina. The city is located on the western shore of the estuary of the Río de la Plata, on the South American continent&amp;rsquo;s southeastern coast. Buenos Aires can be translated as fair winds or good airs, but the former was the meaning intended by the founders in the 16th century, by the use of the original name Real de Nuestra Señora Santa María del Buen Ayre.</description>
