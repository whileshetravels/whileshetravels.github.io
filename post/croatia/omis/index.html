			 	<h1>Starigrad fortress hike in Omis, day trip from Split</h1>
				<h1></h1>
			  <span class="post-date">Wed, Mar 1, 2017</span>
			      

<p>Omis is 25 Km/16 miles from Split and it makes a great day trip from Split. It is where the Cetina river meets the Adriatic sea, and you can imagine how beautiful that place would be.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-reach-omis-from-split">HOW TO REACH OMIS FROM SPLIT</h3>

<p>We took bus 60 which runs every half an hour. Though this bus started from the bus terminal Sukoisan, you can also catch it from the bus station by the Green Market intersection. We caught the 11 AM bus and reached Omis around 11:45 AM. By the way, sit on the right side of the bus while going to Omis to enjoy the scenic view of the Adriatic sea. You can find the schedule here.</p>

<h3 id="starigrad-fortress-hike">STARIGRAD FORTRESS HIKE</h3>

<p>There are quite a few things to do in Omis like exploring its beaches, taking a boat trip through Omis Cetina Canyon, zip-lining, or wandering around the streets of the old town, but we were in the mood of hiking and this small town has a short challenging hike to the Starigrad fortress, which leads you to some breathtaking views.</p>

<p>Starigrad fortress was built in the 15th century for the protection against the Turks. I won’t say this fortress is something extra ordinary, but as you know, it’s never about the destination. It’s the journey which matters. And the hike to this fortress which sits above the town of Omis is splendid.</p>

<p>There are two ways to reach this fortress. One of them is difficult and you might wanna avoid it unless you love dangerous hikes. It starts from the tunnel by the river. You would see the sign of the fortress. I don’t have a lot of information about it because I did not take this route. I have read it is really steep. The second way to reach is from the old town near the main square apartment Omis. You would see a sign indicating the fortress. Take the stair and then will see a second same sign of the fortress, as shown in the picture below.</p>

            <h4>And then take this stair to find the hiking trail</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>Throughout your hike, follow this sign shown in the picture below. At times, we were not sure if we had to go right or left or straight, but these signs are everywhere, and make sure you follow them.</p>

            <h4>You will find this sign everywhere. Just follow it.</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>Throughout the hike, we were greeted with the view of Omis and boy, what a beautiful coastal town surrounded by mountains it is. Seriously, I wanted to take pictures like every minute and though the journey to the top is only upto 45 minutes, it took us about a little more than an hour.</p>

<p>The fortress itself is nothing special as I mentioned before, but the view from the fortress is worth the hike, and it is free too. Mountains, sea, red rooftops houses, boats, everything is there.</p>

<p>After spending sometime, we made our way back and we took the same route. Getting down is kinda tricky. It gets slippery at times. So, be careful, but it takes less time than going up.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/567/33147499942_24e8a12a56_b.jpg"/>

<p>We were hungry and wanted to have lunch. Many restaurants were closed I am not sure why. We found a restaurant called Milo open and we ordered fried calamari and fish soup.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3701/33301653695_fc85e38c66_b.jpg"/>

<p>There was a couple sitting next to us. The man was American and the lady was Danish. We had a good conversation with them about traveling and politics. We strolled around for a bit before heading back to the bus station.</p>

<p>And no sooner did we reach, our bus arrived which was at 3:36 PM. You can find the schedule of the bus 60 back to Split <a href="http://www.promet-split.hr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=98&amp;Itemid=183">here</a>.</p>

<p>I am really glad we did this hike. Even though it is not so popular and people traveling in Croatia prefer beaches, but if you are in Split for few days, give this hike a try.</p>
