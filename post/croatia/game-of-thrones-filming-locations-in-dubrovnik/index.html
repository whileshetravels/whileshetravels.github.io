			 	<h1>Visiting Game of Thrones Filming Locations in Dubrovnik, Croatia</h1>
				<h1></h1>

<p>So you are a GOT fan and happen to be in Dubrovnik. That only means you want to be at the same spot your favorite GOT characters stood/sat/laughed/cried/ate/made love once. Dubrovnik being King’s landing in GOT was the shooting location for many important scenes. I tried my best to visit most of them but being there in winter, and bad weather limited me from visiting every location. I will share whatever I was able to cover and also what I was unable to cover.
I will start first with those locations where you don’t need to pay to go. You can find them in the Old Town for free.</p>

<h3 id="pile-gate">PILE GATE</h3>

            <h4>Pile Gate, one of the four gates leading into The City of Dubrovnik</h4>
        </figcaption>

<p>Pile Gate is the main entrance to the Old Town of Dubrovnik and even if you are not a GOT fan, you will pass through this in order to enter the Old Town.</p>

<h3 id="st-dominic-street">ST. DOMINIC STREET</h3>

</figure>


<p>St. Dominic Street was used in most of the market scenes in King’s Landing. It is located near the Dominican monastery linking Ploče Gate with the main street, Stradun. Also, this was one of the many “Walk of Shame”  shooting locations.</p>

<h3 id="jesuit-staircase">JESUIT STAIRCASE</h3>

<p>Located on the south side of Gundulic Square, the staircase is where most of the “ Walk of Shame” shooting took place, in which Cersei Lannister was forced to walk naked.</p>

<h3 id="outside-the-fort-lovrijenac">OUTSIDE THE FORT LOVRIJENAC</h3>

            <h4>Close enough?</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>Fort Lovrijenac also known as “Dubrovnik’s Gibraltar&rdquo; is situated outside the Old Town on a 37 meters high cliff. Though you need to pay in order to enter the fort (Your Dubrovnik City wall ticket includes the fort), you can find some GOT filming location without going inside.</p>

            <h4>Fort Lovrijenac</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>Many scenes were shot at Fort Lovrijenac including the tournament thrown in honour of King Joffrey’s name day in season two.</p>

<p>The main attraction of Dubrovnik is its City Walls which are a series of defensive stone walls stretching the Old Town completely. The total length of the wall is 1940-meter encompassing five forts and sixteen towers and bastions. There are three entrances to the walls. They include next to St Lukes Church in the east, next to St Saviours Church at the Pile entrance to the Old City and next to the Maritime Museum located at St Johns Fort. You can find many scenes from GOT being filmed here, especially at the forts.</p>

<h3 id="price-of-dubrovnik-city-walls">PRICE OF DUBROVNIK CITY WALLS</h3>

<p>The adult entrance fee costs 120 Kunas or 17 US dollars (visit to Fort Lovrijenac is included in the price. Children (5-18) costs 30 Kunas and free for children under 5 years.</p>

<h3 id="bokar-fortress">BOKAR FORTRESS</h3>

    <img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/742/32958884690_c49f198e6a_b.jpg"/> 
</figure>


<p>Bokar fortress was built in 1461 by Italian architect Michelozzo di Bartololmeo to defend the western entrance to the city of Dubrovnik. The most famous GOT scene shot here was a conversation between Tyrion Lannister and Lord Varys to defend King’s Landing while looking out to sea.</p>

<h3 id="minceta-tower">MINCETA TOWER</h3>

<figure>
    <img src="http://i.imgur.com/X1bZzDf.jpg"/>

</figure>


<p>Minceta tower is the highest point of the walls of Dubrovnik, offering unforgettable view on the old town of Dubrovnik. So, doesn’t matter if you are a GOT fan or not, you should definitely be here as it is considered as the symbol of the city. in GOT, this was “The House of the Undying in the town of Qarth” and Daenerys Targaryen visits the House to search for her stolen dragons in season 2.</p>

<h3 id="inside-the-fort-lovrijenac">INSIDE THE FORT LOVRIJENAC</h3>

<p>As I mentioned already, Fort Lovrijenac is outside the Walls of Dubrovnik on a 37 meters high cliff. Your ticket includes the entrance. So, don’t worry about buying another one.</p>

<h3 id="trsteno-arboretum">TRSTENO ARBORETUM</h3>

<p>I was able to visit only these filming locations of Game of Thrones in Dubrovnik, but if you have more time, you should visit Trsteno Arboretum, which is 15 miles/24km from Dubrovnik. It makes the gardens of King’s landing.</p>

<h3 id="island-of-lokrum">ISLAND OF LOKRUM</h3>

<p>I did not go to Island of Lokrum because there was no boat running in February, but if you happen to visit during summer, it only takes 15 minutes by water taxi to reach there. It is a hot spot for locals and tourists in summer.</p>

</figure>


<p>Dubrovnik, with or without Game of Thrones is a beautiful medieval town, which takes you back to the old times. The city is clean and there is always something happening throughout the year. Food is excellent though a little expensive. And if you are a passionate GOT fan, you gotta be here. You won’t be disappointed.</p>
