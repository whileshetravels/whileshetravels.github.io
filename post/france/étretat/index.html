			 	<h1>Étretat, France</h1>
				<h1></h1>
			  <span class="post-date">Thu, Jan 12, 2017</span>
			      <p>I was looking for a day trip from Paris and Étretat attracted me right away. It is a beautiful small town in Normandie region of France, with pebble beaches and unique shaped cliffs and arches. It takes about 3.5 hours one way from Paris to reach Etretat. I do not think I can justify its beauty in my post, but I would try and pictures would help.</p>

            <h4>The serenity! The view from the Falaise d&#39;amont</h4>

<p>Getting to Étretat from Paris is not difficult. I am not saying it is easy either because we missed our bus. There is no train which goes directly to Étretat. We took a train from Paris Saint Lazare station to Le Havre. We bought the ticket from here and it costed us around 30 euros/person round trip. We took the train at 7:50 AM and reached Le Havre train station at 10:01 AM. The bus #24 from Le Havre to Étretat was supposed to leave at 10:30 AM according to various sources I had checked earlier, but it left at 10:12 AM and we missed it not because we did not make it, but we thought it’s at 10:30 AM. The next bus wasn’t until 1:12 PM. I was really angry and thank God I had my D who calmed me down. Please download the schedule for bus #24 from here and do not miss your bus like we did. The bus stop is adjacent to the train station. You would just have to get off the train real quickly to catch the bus at 10:12 AM. I don’t know why they changed it from 10:30 AM. We killed our time in La Havre by just walking around, but the lunch we had it here is something I would not forget ever. The restaurant name is A Deux Pas d’lci and their cod fish main course is on point. Very reasonable price and wonderful service.</p>

<p>We finally boarded the bus #24 for Étretat. We bought the tickets from the driver for 2 euros/person. It was more than an hour ride. We reached Étretat around 2:20 PM.</p>

<p>The information office is just by the bus stop. We went in and got a free map and the lady explained how to reach the cliffs. There are three famous arches in Étretat but only two of them can be seen from here, the Falaise d&rsquo;aval and the the Falaise d&rsquo;amont.</p>

            <h4>The city of Etretat</h4>

<p>Before arriving here, we were kinda worried how to reach these cliffs, but trust me, once you are here, you would know where to go and the map from the information office helped. Make sure you check the tide timing which is posted right before you enter the beach. We first arrived at the pebble beach and we were greeted with the view of the famous Falaise d&rsquo;aval which appears like an elephant trunk submerged in water.</p>

<p>We climbed up the cliff and loved it as we had missed hiking a lot. It is a pretty easy hike except for some few spots where it gets kinda steep.</p>

<p>Again the view from the top is just breathtaking.</p>

            <h4>Top view</h4>
        </figcaption>

<p>After spending some time on the cliff here, we decided to explore the Falaise d&rsquo;amont, which is on the other side of the beach.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/479/32166825471_58ab46c6e1_b.jpg"/> <figcaption>
            <h4>The sign for the entry to the Falaise d&#39;amont</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>At the top, there is a Church of Notre-Dame and the white bird in the memory of the World War 1 heroes, Charles Nungesser and Francois Coli whose plane, the White Bird got lost in an attempt to make the first non stop flight from Paris to New York.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/334/31909813350_a9114ab3d8_b.jpg"/> <figcaption>
            <h4>The White Bird at Falaise d&#39;amont</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>This is where we got our perfect picture, the very first picture of this post. You could see the Falaise d&rsquo;aval beautiful arches, the church, the off-center bench and the deep colors. And again, being here in January paid off as there were very few people. In summer, it gets pretty crowded as I have heard.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/376/31475970953_b5bc16a88d_b.jpg"/> <figcaption>
            <h4>One last time at the beach</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>We wanted to see the sunset but we had to catch the 5:41 PM bus to Le Havre in order to make it to the 7:10 PM train to Paris. We got the bus #24 from the same spot, Etretat Mairie, right outside the information center and the bus dropped us off at the train station and we reached Paris by 9:40 PM.</p>

<p>If you have a few days in Paris, a day trip to Étretat is totally worth it. Yes, it would be a long day, but you would be rewarded with breathtaking views.</p>
