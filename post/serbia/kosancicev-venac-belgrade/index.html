			 	<h1>Kosancicev venac, Belgrade</h1>
				<h1></h1>
			  <span class="post-date">Thu, Mar 23, 2017</span>
			      <p>Kosancicev  venac is the oldest urban neighborhood in Belgrade, where I am staying at present. Right now it is under construction, but that doesn’t take away its charm. Its Turkish cobblestones, cafes, galleries, and wineries give it the atmosphere of the 19th century.</p>

<p>The neighborhood of Kosancicev  venac
ST. MICHAEL’S CATHEDRAL/SABORNA CRKVA</p>

<p>Though it is not the center of the city, it is close to many important landmarks like Kalemegdan park and fortress, Knez    Mihailova   Street, Republic Square in Belgrade, and this neighborhood boasts of one of the most beautiful Orthodox churches in the world, called St. Michael’s Cathedral built from 1837-40 by order of prince Miloš Obrenović. I did not take any picture inside as it is forbidden to use your phone once in, I can tell you its ceilings have some really beautiful paintings.</p>

<p>PRINCESS LJUBICA RESIDENCE</p>

<p>Another important landmark not to be missed in the neighborhood of Kosancicev   vena is the Residence of Princess Ljubica. The Residence of Princess Ljubica was built by Hadzi Nikola Zivkovic, on orders from Prince Miloš Obrenović during the period from 1829 to 1830, as the private residence of his wife, the Princess Ljubica.</p>

<p>The residence has three levels – basement, 1st floor and 2nd floor. It is a classic example of city houses of Serbian-Balkan style.</p>

<p>The interior and exterior design are in accordance with the Ottoman architecture, where the central place is occupied by a spacious hall surrounded by smaller rooms.</p>

<p>There is a conversation room called Divanhane whose windows are lined up against the walls to ensure air flow and lightening in the central hall. This is where families would gather to talk and sip their coffee.</p>

<p>The Residence of Princess Ljubica also houses the permanent exhibit “Interiors of Belgrade City Houses of the 19thCentury” starting with the Oriental (Turkish), through the influence of Central (Biedermeier) and Western European (Neo-baroque, Neo-rococo, Napoleon III, Altdeutch) styles.</p>

<p>The Residence of Princess Ljubica is an interesting visit which shows the breaking point in architecture of Belgrade. You can see the elements of both oriental and western design and architecture.</p>

<p>KAFANA QUESTION MARK/?</p>

<p>Another interesting landmark in the neighborhood of Kosancicev  venac is a kafana called “?.” Yes, ? is its name and i will tell you later why it is called so. It is s the oldest traditional tavern or kafana in Belgrade. Tavern is a place where people gather for alcohol and food and it also served as a lodging for travelers in the past. &ldquo;?“ was built in 1823 on the order of Miloš Obrenović I, Prince of Serbia. It was designed by an unnamed Greek architect. I still have to eat here, but I have heard food is good though prices are more than other restaurants in Serbia due to its history, probably.</p>

<p>You must be wondering why it is called ?. Right? Well, the owner of this tavern wanted to name it Kod Saborne crkve, which is a church name. Obviously, the church authorities did not like this idea and the owner was not sure what to do next and call it ? and that’s how it got its name.
Kosancicev  venac is a beautiful neighborhood rich in history and close to all the important attractions in Belgrade. You must pay your visit to this neighborhood and even better stay here, if possible.</p>
