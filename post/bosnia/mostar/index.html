			 	<h1>Mostar, a day trip from Sarajevo</h1>
				<h1></h1>
			  <span class="post-date">Tue, Apr 11, 2017</span>
			      <p>The historic town of Mostar spanning a deep valley of Neretva river must be on your list if you are in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is famous for its medieval arched bridge called Stari Most or the Old Bridge built during the Ottoman empire rule, and now there is something else which is gaining popularity worldwide and it is the cliff diving competition. If you do not have enough time, this can easily be a day trip from Sarajevo.</p>

<p><strong>HOW TO GET TO MOSTAR FROM SARAJEVO</strong></p>

<p>You can catch the bus from Sarajevo Central Bus Station. We bought the ticket right before catching our bus, which was at 8:15 AM. It costed 14 KM/person one way, which is like 8 US Dollars. The bus was very comfortable. We sat on the right side of the bus and were rewarded with great sceneries. We reached Mostar by 10:40 AM.</p>

<p><strong>HISTORY OF THE OLD BRIDGE</strong></p>

<p>We had some idea about this town’s history, but we got super lucky. We came across our guide from Sarajevo Total Siege Tour, which we took last Sunday. Our guide, Adnaan, was there with some girls and their teacher on a school field trip. He offered to join them, and without wasting anytime we did. Though there were a few houses before in Mostar, it was during the Ottoman empire in the 15th and 16th centuries that the city grew so much and the urbanization of the settlement took place.</p>

            <h4>The Old Bridge. Be careful while walking as it is pretty slippery when dry and completely fine when wet. Ironical.</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>Before the old bridge was built, there was a wooden bridge connecting the two sides of the town on the river Neretva. Upon request of the people of Mostar, Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent ordered to replace the medieval wooden bridge in 1557. Mimar Hayruddin, a student of Mimar Sinan, the Ottoman architect built this bridge over the span of 9 years. It was completed in 1566. Mimar Hayruddin was not sure if this bridge would hold and he fled away for almost a year in the fear that Sultan would kill him if something goes wrong. When he heard about the success of the bridge and nothing bad had happened, he returned to Mostar. He went on to build some monuments in Sarajevo as well, but this bridge was his biggest achievement. Upon its completion it was the widest man-made arch in the world.</p>

<p><strong>THE NAME MOSTAR</strong></p>

<p>In the beginning, there used to be bridge keepers to collect tolls from people crossing the bridge. Bridge keeper is called mostar in Turkish and hence the town is called Mostar. This bridge was an expensive project which costed 300,000 Drams (silver coins) to build.</p>

<p><strong>DESTRUCTION OF THE OLD BRIDGE</strong></p>

<p>The Old Bridge stood for more than 400 years including the two world wars but it collapsed during the last Bosnian War against Croats on November 9, 1993. It is said Croats did not need to destroy the bridge as it was of no strategic importance, but they did it to destroy the cultural property. Not sure how true that is but that’s one of the many prizes of a war. What we see now is the new bridge which was commissioned to reconstruct in the same way as the previous one, by the UNESCO and other committees. A Turkish company called Er-Bu Construction Corp specialized in Ottoman architectures was given the responsibility for reconstruction. Reconstruction started in June 2001 and it took about 3 years to complete. Additional fund was provided by Italy, Netherlands, Croatia, Turkey, the Council of Europe Development Bank, and the Bosnian government.</p>

<p><strong>DIVING/JUMPING</strong></p>

<p>Every summer, there is a diving competition held where people would dive into the Neretva river from the bridge. Our guide told us that it is dangerous and you need to a special technique in order to dive as water is not very deep and there are a lot of rocks inside water and if not done correctly, one can hit his head and get injured or even die. He also said every year some Australians would try diving off the bridge and hurt themselves. Last year some local won the competition. The story of how diving started goes something like this and it is a legend. There was a coffee shop with on the hill and some rich people would throw off silver coins in the river. Young boys would jump into the river to take those coins and also to show off to young girls. And that’s how the tradition started. In summer, besides the diving competition, there would be divers collecting money from tourists and if they collect 20 euros, they jump into the river..jump and not dive, but jumping ain’t easy either. Last year girls started taking part in diving competition too.</p>

<p>We explored the rest of Mostar and took pictures from every angle and you could see for yourself what a beautiful town Mostar is.</p>

<p>The Crooked bridge is another important bridge built during the Ottoman time in Mostar connecting north and south and east and west. The bridge was still standing after the last war, but collapsed at the end of 1999. It was rebuilt in 2002.</p>

<p>We wandered around the Old Town. Just like every Old Town, there were a lot of alleys with gift and souvenir shops.</p>

<p>Our guide took us to <strong>Koski Mehmed-Pasha Mosque</strong> which was built in 1618. In the age of no TV or internet, people both Muslims and non-Muslims used to gather in the mosque for information.</p>

<p>It is a beautiful mosque and if you are up for climbing its super narrow staircase to reach the minaret, you would be rewarded with the best panoramic view of the town, the one in my very first picture.</p>

            <h4>The inside of the mosque</h4>

<p>We paid 6 euros/person to go to the minaret and it also included the terrace. If you only wanna go to the terrace, it costs 3 euros, but the views from the terrace is nowhere near the one from the Minaret. It is not easy to get to the minaret. The staircase is super narrow. There were only 2 of us. So, it was alright, but if there are more people, like in summer, it can be challenging, but doable. Just be careful and mindful of everyone.</p>

<p>Mostar has some great inexpensive restaurants. We had our lunch at Hindin Han, where food wasn’t just delicious but the portion was big too and the view of Neretva river was great. We had beef liver with fries and salad and it costed us only like 7 dollars. We just ordered one dish because it was too much for us.</p>

<p>After our lunch, we explore the city a little more. There were a fair amount of American tourists buying things in the Old Town.</p>

<p>We also checked out the Austrian-Hungarian side of the town.</p>

<p>This and many other destroyed buildings are a good reminder of Mostar (and the Balkans) troubled past.</p>

<p>Came across this cemetery while making our way back to the bus station. Our bus was at 3 PM and we made it back to Sarajevo at 5:30 PM.</p>

<p>If you are staying in Mostar for a couple of days or more, you should check out the following places as well.</p>

<ol>
<li>Kravice Waterfalls and you can even swim there in summer.</li>
<li>Blagaj which is only 15 KM from Mostar is home to Buna river spring and also has the dervish monastery built in 1520</li>
<li>Počitelj, which was built on a cliff on the left bank of Neretva.</li>
<li>Hiking to the Hum Mountain</li>
</ol>

<p>All I can say after visiting Mostar is that the war couldn’t take away the beauty of this town. There are scars of the last war everywhere, and they are just a reminder to the humankind how selfish and cruel we humans could be. Cheers to the people of Mostar and the whole Bosnia and Herzegovina for fighting everyday to overcome the crimes of war against them.</p>
