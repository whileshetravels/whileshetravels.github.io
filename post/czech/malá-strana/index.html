			 	<h1>Malá Strana (Lesser Town), Prague</h1>
				<h1></h1>
			  <span class="post-date">Thu, Dec 22, 2016</span>
			      

<p>Malá Strana also known as the Lesser Town is no less beautiful, though it is definitely less touristy than Old Town. Its name comes from the fact that it was the smaller half of Prague and is situated below the Castle on the left bank of the Vltava river and is connected to the larger towns of Prague by the Charles bridge.</p>

            <h4>Beautiful district of Malá Strana with its cobblestoned streets</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>As always, we left our apartment in Prague early, around 8:30 AM. We took tram 22 from I.P. Pavlova (Praha -2), and got off at Malostranské námésti. I believe tram 12 and 20 go here too. Alternatively, you can also take the metro line A to Malostranská station. If you are visiting the castle, you could just walk down the hill to Lesser Town or just use the Charles Bridge to walk from Old Town to Lesser Town.
Honestly, you could just stroll around the cobblestoned narrow streets and you won’t get tired, but there are some points of interest you might want to check.</p>

<h3 id="st-nicholas-church">ST. NICHOLAS’ CHURCH</h3>

<p>There is a St. Nicholas’ Church in Old Town too, but it can not beat the one here. Built in 1700 by Kilian Dientzenhofer, it is one of the most beautiful Baroque churches in Europe.</p>

            <h4>St. Nicholas’ Church with its 70m high dome and its 79m-tall belfry</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>The entrance fee is 70 CZK (December 2016), and it is totally worth it. It is well preserved and the interior is more beautiful than can be imagined.</p>

            <h4>Cupola of St. Nicholas Church</h4>
        </figcaption>

<p>There is a Baroque organ which was played by Mozart when he was in Prague.</p>

            <h4>Interior of the church</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>We also went to the balcony and the view from there was even better.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/316/31446228183_78362a8966_b.jpg"/> <figcaption>
            <h4>Picture does not do the justice how beautiful the view was from the balcony</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>There were not many people when we were there (December, 2016) and it gave us an opportunity to appreciate the frescoes, the oil paintings, and ornate statues.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/738/32137097661_f1e0806dbe_b.jpg"/> <figcaption>
            <h4>St. Nicholas’ Church with its 70m high dome and its 79m-tall belfry</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>St. Nicholas’ Church is very impressive. It is super rich in size, materials, decoration and its artwork.</p>

<h3 id="church-of-our-lady-victorious">CHURCH OF OUR LADY VICTORIOUS</h3>

<p>This church is a little different from other churches I have been to. It is famous because it has an Infant Jesus wax figure which was presented to the church by Polyxena of Lobkowicz in 1628.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/649/32256319395_f6c6a29b6a_b.jpg"/> <figcaption>
            <h4>The infant Jesus in the middle</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>It is told that the Infant Jesus saved Prague from the plague and from the destruction of the 30 year war, and therefore, a lot of people from all over the world visit this church. We spend about 20 minutes here. I found it alright.</p>

<figure>

            <h4>The painting of the infant Jesus dressed in a beautiful robe</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>Outside the church, there are many shops which sell copies of the Infant Jesus wax figure. Something you might wanna buy.</p>

<h3 id="lennon-wall">Lennon Wall</h3>

<p>If you love Beatles, you must visit Lennon Wall and even if you don&rsquo;t, you should. It hardly takes 10-15 minutes and you don&rsquo;t have to go out of your way to see it, but do use Google map to locate it. Otherwise, it is easy to get lost in the maze of small streets and lanes.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3935/33374758786_cf3eb2879f_b.jpg"/> <figcaption>
            <h4>Lennon Wall</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>The wall is covered in meaningful messages and quotes, so colorful and beautiful. It is tribute to John Lennon, this wall is a vibrant platform for fans.</p>

<h3 id="prague-venice-boat-trip">PRAGUE VENICE BOAT TRIP</h3>

<p>We were on Kampa island and just when we started to explore it, we saw a boat with a lady. I made an inquiry what this is about and the lady told me it is about a 45 minute guided boat tour which explains the history of Prague from the Vlatava river and take us to the canal.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/742/31414920984_d641323e10_b.jpg"/> <figcaption>
            <h4>That’s the small boat we took initially.</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>We took the boat from there which took us to the starting point, Krizovnicke namesti, beside the Charles Bridge. You can directly go there and get the tickets, which costs 290 CZK, around 12 euros.</p>

</figure>


<p>When we got there, we were asked to wait 20 minutes for the next boat in English guided tour. So, we decided to hang around the Charles bridge. The boat tour also includes free entrance to the Charles Bridge museum, but we would use it some other time.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/679/32256265835_eee36e58ba_b.jpg"/> <figcaption>
            <h4>Took this snap while waiting for our boat</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>After 20 minutes, we were able to board our boat. It was completely full and warm too as the weather was cold. The sailor of our ship was dressed in white, kind of corny but cute. The guided tour was in both English and Spanish. We were served hot tea/coffee/wine/bear and some cookies.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/734/31446128633_d67c365fb7_b.jpg"/> <figcaption>
            <h4>The view from our boat. So pretty. :)</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>I found the tour very informative and I learned a lot about Prague history. Our guide who was also our sailor made it funny and explained to what various buildings were and their history. We were also able to see the Castle from our boat.</p>

            <h4>A memorable boat tour</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>The boat then took us down the stream to view what’s called Prague Venice and to the Devil’s stream up to the Grand Priory Mill.</p>

<p>Prague Venice boat trip is a good fun way to appreciate how beautiful this city is and how rich it is in its history. You can find more information <a href="http://trips-tickets.com/product/prague-venice-river-canal-boat-trip">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you get tired of all the hustle and bustle of the Castle and Old Town and the Charles Bridge, you find some peace here at Malá Strana. With its cobbled streets, you would find many small shops, restaurants, pubs, and beautiful churches. Though I am not staying here, I have heard it is a great location to stay in Prague. Most hotel buildings here are ancient and who does not love ancient things with a modern touch. Right?</p>
