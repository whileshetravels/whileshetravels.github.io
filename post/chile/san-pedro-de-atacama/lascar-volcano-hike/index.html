<p>Láscar volcano in northern Chile is the most active of the northern Chilean Andes. Lascar is an andesitic-to-dacitic stratovolcano with 3 overlapping summit craters. Large lava flows are visible on its NW flanks. Lascar is flanked 5 km to the east by the older, but higher Volcán Aguas Calientes stratovolcano.</p>

<p>The most important ones are Licancabut, Sairecabur, Llullolico (the three at the international border), Lascar, Paniri, Linzor volcanoes stand at 5500m above sea levels, therefore it is fundamental to spend a few days adaoptinh to the altitude.</p>

<p>We finalized the hike to Lascar volcano with our usual tour company, <em>Chakana expedition</em>. Our guide was <em>Jaime</em>, with whom we had done our very first tour in Atacama, Altiplanic Lagoons Tour. He gave us the logistics of the tour and explained the risks associated with it. We also had to register with the San Pedro police. I was nervous about hiking this volcano, to be honest. We had never been so high and wasn’t sure if we could do it. I was also scared about the volcano erupting, and the wind and the cold. So, basically this whole hike was very intimidating, but we wanted something exciting and changing from our usual trips. So, we agreed to do it. We got picked up from our Airbnb place at 5:30 AM. It was supposed to be only 2 of us and Jaime, but we had 6 more guys from Brazil and another guide named Dani in the car. We were happy that there were more people to hike with us.</p>

<p>We drove to the base of the hike, which took us about 1.5 hours ago. We had breakfast at a lagoon, provided by the tour company. We wore more warm clothes which Jaime had brought for us. We then drove to the base camp. We were explained that it would take us about 2 hours to reach the crater and another 45 minutes to reach the summit, if we decide to attempt that. Since we didn’t come in a jeep, we had to walk a little bit more to start the hike. That walk wasn’t easy. It was very steep and I was going super slow, but still getting tired. All the Brazilians went up so fast and I was like wow! How did that happen. And in the meantime my husband kept on telling me I am not walking properly. Arggh! Our guides and the other guys waited for us until we made it to the actual starting point of the hike. One of the Brazilian guys offered me to take my backpack as his back was free, and I guess he figured out I’d have a hard time going up. I agreed right away. So, Dani, our other guide was leading the hike. He put me behind him, then my husband, and then the other guys and Jaime was all the way at the end. We were walking up in a single file line. I was the slowest one in the group but everybody was fine with it. No one was in any rush. I stopped from time to time to catch my breath. I was given tips from both my husband and Dani on how to breath. Deep inhale through the nose and slow exhale through the mouth. I was trying my best to follow that but breathing like that required a lot of energy and I was getting tired easily. We took a few breaks in between to drink water and eat snacks, and after one break, Jaime told us that Dani and the other guys would go up on their own as they wanted to go to the summit too and by this time it was clear I wouldn’t be able to make to the summit. So, it was 3 of us now. It was getting really difficult at this point for me. My head was hurting too, which is normal at high altitude. Jaime took my arm and we started walking together. I was pausing more than ever at this point. When we were about 200 meters before the crater, I sat down on a rock, and I was so tired my eyes were closing down. It was getting a little hazy. My husband wanted to go back at this point but I felt bad that he wouldn’t be able to make even to the crater due to me. So, I assured him I am feeling better, which I was, after resting for a while, and he should go at least to the crater with Jaime, and I would wait for them to return. To my surprise, he agreed and they went up. In the meantime, there was this kind man, named Nicholas, who was also a guide, saw me sitting on the rock. He checked up on me that I am really okay. He checked my skin color and he said I’m fine. I did start feeling better and he asked me if I’d like to make to the crater as it’s really close by. I could see the finish line and I said, “let’s do it.” So, I started the last leg of this journey with this complete stranger. I asked if I could put my hand over his arm and he said yes. I saw my husband and Jaime coming down and they saw me too. They stopped for me. My husband was so happy to see me walking up again. I stopped three times before making to the crater. Everyone clapped for me and I felt so proud of myself. My husband and I thanked Nicholas and I sat down to relax. I stood up slowly with the help of my husband and saw the crater. Man, it is so big, way bigger than I had imagined. It was too deep to stare down all the way in the crater. We saw the fumaroles and smelled sulfur and it was breathtaking. We started the descent. We were going down way faster than we had ascended, but of course Brazilian guys and Dani were gone like a wind. I got the altitude sickness halfway and I threw up. I started getting dizzy again but I wanted to make to the car ASAP. Jaime suggested the same thing. We finally got to the car and I threw up again. Surprise Surprise!! After that, everyone agreed I should sit in the front to avoid the sickness. I went to sleep right away. I woke up after 45 minutes or so. I was feeling better but after a while vomited again. I went to sleep again and when I woke up, we were at our airbnb place. My husband and I thanked and apologized to everybody in the car but they were all happy I made it alive. I was sick for the rest of the day..nauseated and intense headache. Wasn’t able to eat anything as everytime I tried, I ended up throwing up. I felt better the next day after having a good night sleep.</p>

<p>So, in a nutshell, Lascar volcano which is a little more than 18000 feet up is not easy. Take it slow and breathe properly, if you attempt to try it. At any point, you don’t feel like you can make it, take a rest for a while and assess your situation. And please go with a guide or two or three!!!!!</p>
