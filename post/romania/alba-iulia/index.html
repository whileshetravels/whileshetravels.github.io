			 	<h1>Alba Iulia, day trip from Sibiu</h1>
				<h1></h1>
			  <span class="post-date">Sat, Apr 8, 2017</span>
			      

<p>We first came to know about Alba Iulia from our Airbnb host, Diana, in Timisoara. We had to go to Sibiu from Timisoara and the bus ride was about 6 hours. Diana suggested we go to Alba Iulia first, stay there for a night, and then go to Sibiu. It did not work out for us as we had already booked an Airbnb apartment in Sibiu. In Sibiu, our host also mentioned Alba Iulia that we can easily do a day trip from Sibiu. It takes only 1.5 hours to get there and there are a lot of buses running back and forth. We finally went to Alba Iulia a day before we were leaving Sibiu. Not sure why we waited so long.</p>

<h3 id="history-of-alba-iulia">HISTORY OF ALBA IULIA</h3>

<p>Alba Iulia is a city in Transylvania region of Romania, with a population of with a population of about 64,000. It is one of the oldest settlements in Romania and used to be called Apulum. It was an important city for the Romans, serving as the capital of the Roman Empire’s province of Dacia. It was the largest military and economic center during their time. In 1541, Alba Iulia became the capital of the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom reaching its peak, and It was here that on December 1st 1918, the province of Transylvania announced its unification with Romania. Romania used to be three separate regions until 1918: Transylvania, Walachia, and Moldova. In 1922, this is where the first king of Greater Romania, Prince Ferdinand, was crowned. So yea, Alba lulia may not be the capital of Romania, but it is one of the most important cities in Romania.
HOW TO REACH ALBA LULIA FROM SIBIU</p>

<p>The best way to reach Alba Iulia from Sibiu is by bus. We took a bus at 10:43 AM from Autogara Q7 ( a small bus station) and reached Alba Iulia by 12:30 PM. You can find the schedule of buses here. It is about a 20 minute walk to the old town/citadel from the bus station.</p>

<h3 id="alba-iulia-citadel">ALBA IULIA CITADEL</h3>

<p>Alba Iulia is famous for its star shaped citadel, which is the biggest in Romania. Designed by an Italian architect Giovanni Morando Visconti, it was built between 1716 and 1735, using the Vauban military architectural system. It has 7 gates and all of them are interesting, but in my opinion gate III is the most impressive one, decorated with intricate carvings on both facades.</p>

<p>There are a lot of cool statues we found while strolling around. Everyone was trying to get a picture or two with the statues. This citadel is really clean and full of cafes and stalls. If you decide to be here in summer (May to September) , it’s even better. There is a guard change ceremony every day at noon, taking place nearby the 3rd and 4th Citadel Gates. It’d definitely take you back to the old times.</p>

<p>In the citadel, St. Michael’s catholic Cathedral is pretty outstanding. Built between 1247 and 1291, it is of romanesque style. The tomb of Prince Iancu de Hunedoara and of Polish-born Isabella Jagiełło, former Queen of Hungary. are located here.</p>

<p>There is also an orthodox Cathedral of the Reunification at the western entrance. It was built between 1921 and 1923 to celebrate Transylvania’s reunification with Romania.</p>

<p>Besides these two churches, you can also find the Union Hall with the National Honour Gallery, The National History Museum of Unification, the Voivodal Palace, the Batthyaneum Library, the Roman Catholic bishop’s palace, the Apor Palace, and the University of Alba Iulia.</p>

<p>Strolling around this citadel is like a living history lesson about plenty of chapters of Romania history, containing Romanian nation birth and the three countries unions. A coup of hours should be enough for this place. There was a bus at 3:30 and we took that to go back to Sibiu. I am so glad we listened to our Airbnb hosts and saw this magnificent citadel.</p>
