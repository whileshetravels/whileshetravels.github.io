<h4 id="campsite-for-the-night-gesthús-selfoss-campsite">Campsite for the night: Gesthús Selfoss Campsite</h4>

<p>We spent the last night in the parking lot of the Vatnajökull National Park. <strong>Vatnajökull</strong> is the largest glacier in Europe and you can even do glacier hiking, if you like that sort of things. You can find two different tour companies in the National park itself which do glacier hiking and ice caving. We didn’t do either of them as I had cramps in my right leg. What we rather did was walk to the glacier and admire it without stepping on it.</p>

            <h4>Vatnajökull Glacier</h4>

</figure>


<p>Vatnajökull is big..like really big, surrounded by smaller glaciers. You might recognize it as North of the Wall or Beyond the Wall in the HBO fantasy series Game of Thrones. Also, if you are into James Bond movies, Die Another Day and A View to a Kill were shot here.</p>

<p>It is a fairly easy hike to the glacier and it took us about 1.5 hours round trip. We stopped to take many pictures too. The whole glacier was just to us as we had left pretty early. It was one of the most calmed mornings for us. Standing next to a gigantic glacier and trying to hear what it has to say to both of us. It might be saying how we humans are destroying it. Shame on us!</p>

<p>Another major thing to do in the Vatnajökull National Park is to hike up a waterfall called <strong>Svartifoss</strong>. It takes about a total of 2 hours. We did not do it thanks to my leg as the first part of the hike is an uphill but gets pretty easy later on.</p>

<p>We left the national park to go further south, stopping here and there for the attractions.</p>

<p>Our first major stop was at the <strong>Fjaðrárgljúfur canyon</strong>, located right off the ring road. Driving there could get a little rough. It is recommended to use a 4 wheel drive but we along with others were fine with our regular car. This canyon is about 100 meters deep and 2 Km long, making for a nice little walk once you get there.</p>

            <h4>Fjaðrárgljúfur canyon</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>The best thing about the Fjaðrárgljúfur is that it is not a top touristy site. Maybe because you can’t find a lot of information about it on brochures.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4190/34770024466_a5ea784e1a_b.jpg"/> 
</figure>


<p>It is truly a beautiful canyon which you can walk both along the top off and with the right shoes and depending on the water level along the bottom off as well.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4268/33966167084_a8f6b54735_b.jpg"/> 
</figure>


<p>We spent about an hour roundtrip at the canyon, and continued driving further south. At one point, the landscape changed dramatically, and we saw a lot of small to big rocks piled one over another. That gave us great aesthetic pleasure.</p>

<p>We stopped our car and decided to check out. At that point, stepping out of car to find out what&rsquo;s there had become routine. And that&rsquo;s what Iceland road trip is about. It is not just seeing the major attractions, but to explore some off beaten paths which come up while driving.</p>

<p>So back to the rocks. It is called <strong>Laufskálavarða</strong> - the Cairn of Laufskálar. The name Laufskálavarða comes from the fact that there used to be a big Viking farm, called Laufskálar, in the area, but was destroyed in a Katla eruption in 894, which is the first recorded eruption in Katla after the Settlement of Iceland in ca 874. The volcano Katla is one of the most dangerous volcanoes of Iceland and has erupted several times in the past.</p>

<p>The story of this stone piles found in this area is that traditionally everyone passing by this area was supposed to add a stone to a cairn for good fortune to their journey through this dangerous area. This tradition is still followed and now tourists are doing the same. Yes, we did it too and it was fun, being part of one of the Iceland&rsquo;s tradition.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4193/34676585761_b2bc5748b8_b.jpg"/> 
</figure>


<p>There are rocks always available for everyone thanks to the Icelandic Road Administration. We saw stone piles at other places too, nothing like this though. It is forbidden to pile up stones at other locations in Iceland. Please keep in mind.</p>

<p>I was excited for our next big stop, which was the <strong>Black Sand Beach</strong> also known as Reynisfjara beach. It is one of the top sights of Iceland and we saw a lot of people there. It was almost impossible to take pictures without someone photobombing it, but before reaching the Black sand beach, we made a few more stops including at the mossy lava rock.</p>

<p>Black Sand beach is located near the village Vik. I forgot to mention we had pizza and French chocolate fondue at one of the restaurants in Vik. Even though the restaurant was packed with tourists, we got our food without much delay. We even went on to do some grocery shopping in Vik as we were running out of our food supply.</p>

<p>Back to the black sand beach in Vik. It is absolutely beautiful. The sand is as black as can be. The beach has amazing rock coves dotted around with unique rock formations. It also has a beautiful cliff of regular basalt columns resembling a rocky step pyramid, which is called Hálsanef.</p>

<p>You gotta be really careful with the waves here. This is not your typical beach where you can relax and go into the water. Waves are super strong and there have been many accidents already due to people ignoring the warning sign. So, please please please be mindful of this and pay attention.</p>

<p>Our next destination was one of the biggest waterfalls in Iceland, called <strong>Skogafoss</strong>. As we were driving, we saw a lot of cars parked at one point, and that&rsquo;s the thing with Iceland. Sometimes you don&rsquo;t even know what you are going to see. We parked our car and decided to check out what&rsquo;s there. We had walked for 5 minutes when I suggested D let&rsquo;s find out what&rsquo;s there. He said let&rsquo;s get surprised. I liked his idea. We walked and walked and there were many other people too just walking. After 20 minutes, when we were nowhere close to whatever we were gonna see, we asked a lady what it is. She said it&rsquo;s a crashed plane from 70s and a beach. It is called <strong>Sólheimasandur Plane Crash</strong>. On Saturday Nov 24, 1973 a United States Navy Douglas Super DC-3 airplane was forced to land on Sólheimasandur’s black sand beach in the south of Iceland as it ran out of fuel. Fortunately, everyone survived. And now, this abandoned plane has become a hot shot in Iceland thanks to its remote location. We walked for 10 more minutes and decided not to go any further. We were really exhausted and that plane was nowhere close. Turns out it&rsquo;s a total of 8 Km walk. If you wanna do it, you should definitely be here early when you are fresh.</p>

<p>I was disappointed, but things happen. We continued driving to Skogafoss. It is about 200 feet tall and 50 feet wide.</p>

<p>You can view the waterfall from both top and bottom. We took stairs to go up and see what the waterfall has to offer. There are a lot of stairs, around 400, and my right knee was still hurting, but I thought what the heck. I am not so weak.</p>

<p>If the weather is right, you get beautiful double rainbows from all of the mist too. We came down and admired the waterfall from close, but my favorite waterfall would always be <strong>Seljalandsfoss</strong>, which was our next stop. It is pretty close to Skogafoss.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4204/34422799160_4a7cd4c1e5_b.jpg"/> <figcaption>
            <h4>Seljalandsfoss</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>What makes Seljalandsfoss special is that you can walk behind it into a small cave. We had our rain suit on and we wanted to something adventurous to end our day. Going behind the waterfall is not difficult, but the sheer power and force of water so close to you makes it super scary and well fun too.</p>

<p>So, we were right at the edge trying to make a 360 degree video via go pro and all of a sudden we got soaked in water due to the wind getting strong from nowhere. Our hearts skipped a beat and for a moment I thought is that it? But we were quick to get away from there in no moment. That beautiful crazy moment got recorded to our luck. This was definitely one of the major highlights of my Iceland trip.</p>

<p>I would encourage you to go behind this waterfall, but just be careful. We were fortunate and nothing happened. Don&rsquo;t try to be on the edge. The weather of Iceland is crazily unpredictable.</p>

<p>It was a hectic day but we managed. Our campsite for tonight and for the next three days was Gesthús Selfoss Campsite in Selfoss. If you are in south Iceland trying to cover Golden circle and other areas, this should be the place you should be staying at. It costs 1500 Icelandic kronas. It is equipped with hot shower, a dining room, and a kitchen..something very similar to the campsite Hamrar in Akureyri. The only difference was there was no separate showers, but at this time of the year, when it&rsquo;s not so crowded, I managed to have it all to myself. :)</p>
