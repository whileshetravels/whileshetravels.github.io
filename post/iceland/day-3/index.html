<h4 id="campsite-for-the-night-egilsstadir-camping-site">Campsite for the night: Egilsstadir Camping site</h4>

<p>Having slept soundly previous night at Hamrar campsite in Akureyri, we woke up fresh and all set to explore the east Iceland. But first thing first. We took shower which was what we really needed. Then, we fixed ourselves some eggs and bread in the kitchen of our campsite.</p>

            <h4> Driving further up in the north</h4>
        </figcaption>

<p>Our today’s objective was to reach the east of Iceland. Our first stop was the <strong>Godafoss waterfall</strong> on route 1, one of the most spectacular waterfalls in Iceland.</p>

            <h4> Godafoss aka waterfall of the Gods</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>The sheer power and thunderous sound from the water spilling down the falls can be heard from the road. It offers spectacular views from every angle, and you can access it both from the East or West side, with ample parking on both sides.</p>

 <strong>Such a powerfull waterfall</strong></p>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: <em>East side has better views. Park your car at a nearby gas station and hike about 1 km to the waterfall. To access from the west side, you don&rsquo;t have to walk much.</em></p>

<p>It is 12 meters in height and 30 meters in width, falling into a glacial river, the Skjálfandafljót that runs across a 7000 years old lava field.</p>

<p>There is an interesting story behind its name. It was the year 1000, when the Lawspeaker, Þorgeir Ljósvetningagoði, who was also a pagan priest and chieftain, chose Christianity as the official religion of Iceland. He then visited Goðafoss and threw the statues of the Old Norse Gods into the waterfall. Hence, the name Goðafoss.</p>

<p>We then started driving to the famous <strong>Mývatn lake area</strong>. Mývatn is a volcanic lake, formed during a massive eruption 2300 years ago. The whole area has many top attractions of Iceland, mainly volcanic attractions, situated at only at short distances from each other. We first stopped at <strong>Skútustaðagígar pseudo craters</strong>. So, they look like craters but they actually are not. They were formed by gas explosions in lava flow.</p>

<p>There are two hiking options, both of them leading to good view points and birdwatching opportunities. We opted for option 1. We parked our car in the parking lot near the Hotel Gigur. We fixed ourselves quick lunch..noodles and soup and filling our bellies, we went for a short hike. This trail goes around the pond.</p>

            <h4> Hiking up</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>It took us about an hour round trip. A fairly easy hike with some good view points. We did not come across any birds though. Honestly, I would suggest doing this if you have some time in your hand. It&rsquo;s nothing extraordinary.</p>

<p>We were hungry at this point and it was time for lunch. We made noodels and soup, just like all the other time.</p>

            <h4> Food tastes better in a beautiful setting</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>We drove further up to the <strong>Dimmuborgir Lava Field</strong>. As the name suggests, it is a massive lava field, which consists of volcanic caves and rock formations.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4164/33795020883_34b94bcc50_b.jpg"/> <figcaption>
            <h4> Dimmuborgir</h4>
        </figcaption>

<p>Its geology is pretty unique and worth checking. It also happens to be one of the filming locations of Game of Thrones.</p>

<p>There are several trails from small to big, one of them leading to the Hverfjall Volcano. This is where white walkers trudged beyond the Wall. This would take about 2-3 hours and is kinda tricky. We did not do it as we did not have enough time. We chose an easier trail called kirkjuhringur. This basically covers the actual Dimmuborgir and most people opt for this one. It is about an hour walk.</p>

        </figcaption>

<p>The next stop was <strong>Grjotagja Cave</strong>,a natural thermal pool. No, you can&rsquo;t take a dip inside because water temperature is around 45 degrees Celcius. So, a little too hot for our gentle bodies.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4171/34563426796_f4e35ac611_b.jpg"/> <figcaption>
            <h4> Apparently Jon Snow was here.</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>Also, if you happen to be a fan of the love story of Jon Snow and Ygritte, you must visit this place, as the famous love scene in a cave took place here.</p>

<p>Our next stop was one of the most interesting and beautiful things in Iceland, <strong>Myvatn nature bath</strong>.Having done our research about the famous Blue Lagoon that how crowded that place is and most of the time, undergoing construction, we knew we didn&rsquo;t wanna be there, and we also knew that your trip to Iceland is incomplete without going in one of the geothermal baths. So, we went for Myvatn nature bath. I will tell you why.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4159/33761847154_e136e59ed0_b.jpg"/> <figcaption>
            <h4> Take me back to this amazing wonder of the world.</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>We did not prebook or anything like you have to do in Blue Lagoon. We reached there around 4:30 PM. Make sure you have your swim suits with you. You can rent them too but why would you do that. Right? So, we paid 3800 Icelandic Kronas/person, which is around 36 USD. Before entering the pool, you must take a shower and no shoes are allowed in shower area. There are showers with both curtains and no curtains depending on what you prefer. Going to the pool from the shower area in your swim suit in such a cold windy weather requires some courage, but once that&rsquo;s done, it feels you are in heaven. Myvatn feels super natural and in winter, steam is constantly wafting around, giving the whole bath a romantic feel.</p>

<p>It was not super crowded and we did not see many people with their phones. Most of them were truly relaxing and not caring about taking pictures to post on their social media. I was one of those people.Therefore, I don&rsquo;t have many pictures from this place.</p>

<p>I do not know how to swim. What a shame! But that was no problem for me and I am not even tall. Water doesn&rsquo;t run very deep. And now the location of the pool. Who doesn&rsquo;t wanna be surrounded with snowy mountains and dramatic landscape, while enjoying the warm waters of the pool.</p>

<p>We stayed in water for about 2 hours and honestly, we did not wanna leave, but had to. You should take shower again, just to be on the safe side.</p>

<p>We came out so relaxed and fresh, and once again ready to explore more of the area around Myvatn lake. We walked around <strong>Mt. Námafjall</strong>, which is is a high-temperature geothermal area, with fumaroles and boiling, bubbling mud pots. It reminded me of my time in the Lassen Volcanic National Park.</p>

            <h4> Nature is so beautiful.</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>Weather was alright and it was not so windy. We enjoyed strolling around and watching those mud pots boiling relentlessly with energy. Please be careful here especially, if it&rsquo;s windy. It&rsquo;s possible to get sulfur poisoining.</p>

<p>So, around 7, we decided to call it a day. We drove to <a href="http://www.visitegilsstadir.is/en/where-to-stay/egilsstadir-camping-ground">Egilsstadir Camping site</a>, which is in Egilsstadir, a town in east Iceland. It is open all year round. We were expecting a kitchen and a dining room here too, just like our stay at Hamrar campsite site in Akureyri, but we were disappointed. Nonetheless, this camping site was fine too wih hot shower and clean restrooms. We met a couple from Belgium here, who were in Iceland for 3 weeks. We were like whaaaaat? 3 weeks. We made soup and noodles using our stove and went sleeping right away. And that&rsquo;s how day 3 in Iceland ended.</p>
